# Why study algorithms? 
- Their impact is board and far-reaching.
- Old roots, new opportunities.
- To solve problem that could not otherwise be addressed.
- For intellectual stimulation.
- To become a proficient programmer.
- They may unlock the secrets of life and of the universe.(wow)
- For fun and profit:)
# Union Find program

## Problem：Dynamic Connectivity 


![Dynamic_Connectivity__10_23_](/img/Dynamic_Connectivity__10_23_.png)

So there are so many applications. 

Union-find data type  

### Quick-find 


quadratic time - Too slow! 
squared time 

### Quick-union[lazy approach] 


### Quick-Union Improvements 
If it’s tall, it not so good. 

Union : 

Time and space must have a balance. 
depth :log2N 

Thinking Process. 
N=2∧x 
x= lgN 

Improvement2: path compression 
Quick union with path compression. WQUPC 
id[i] = id[ id[i] ]; 

## Application

When looking iTunes Store, I find some wonderful courses about building apps with Swift. 
Here is the topic:

So I choose one of it to become today's course.
First, I see the whole picture of this course and its course plan.
Then, I get similar with the Xcode. Learning its main board and keyboard Shortcuts. The [Course's Materials]("http://swifteducation.github.io/teaching_app_development_with_swift/wordcollage.html) provide a clear picture:

How about others you have learned?
When I learn Java, there is no mention of AutoLayout. At first, we learn the java language and then learn its GUI. Using java code to design is much more difficult for the beginners. Actually many of my classmates are use the old way to design the UI. I wonder why not use WindowsBuilder which is a visible tool to design User Interface? On the other hand, when I use MFC to build a manage system, we also use the visible tool. I guess the desktop application and the mobile application is different in this way. How about the web design? It will change its layout and size too. Medium is the label for it.


Why we use the AutoLayout ?

1. For varies of devices

2. [Adopting Multitasking Enhancements on iPad](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/AdoptingMultitaskingOniPad/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015145-CH3-SW1)

Interface Builder provides us with a square canvas
##1.2 Opening
StoryBoard is square board, while the real devise isn't.
###1.3 How it works? How could it build once and can adapt to different circumstances?  
The Keynote shows the main idea.Relative Positioning and Sizing.**We use constraints to define how things should be positioned relatively.** I think, in some way, it looks like Layout of CSS.

All the Materials is `Simple、Clear、Understandable`.
others:
- Blue: all right
- Orange: I need more constraints.
- Pin 
- Align control
- using SortCuts to fix issue: option command = 
 rotate: command ->

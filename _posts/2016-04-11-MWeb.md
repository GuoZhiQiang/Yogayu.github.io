Let's test the MWeb.
It's a Markdown editor.

How can you describe a diagram?
First of all, you should tell what's the general idea it lead to. Then you talk about the details. On the one hand you can describe the trendy. Such as increase or decrease. On the other hand you may talk about the differences. At last, you should make the conclusion.


Code Example:
			
	int i,j,k;
	DEFINE PAN 300;
	if(i=0;i<PAN;i++)				
	{
		int j = 2.3;
		int k = 2.4;
		i = j + K;
		j++;
		k++;
	}
